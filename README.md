Your task is to implement class Line Calculator. All methods in class should be support dot notation.
The priority of different operations should be kept in mind. It means, that 2 + 2 * 2 is 6, not 8.

Details:
  - create class LineCalculator
  - create class LineCalculator
  - init class default value (number)
  - add methods:
    1. add(number) 
    2. subtract(number) 
    3. multiply(number)
    4. devide(number) 
    5. pow(number)
  - when we use Line Calculator with NSlog() method, method should be print current result
